					Programme Outcomes (PO)
				</Card.Header>
				<Card.Body>
					<Card.Text>
						- Graduates will apply knowledge acquired in
						Mathematics, Science and Engineering to Electronics and
						Communication Engineering problems.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will have the ability to define the state of
						the art problems and technical plan to provide solutions
						by dividing them into small steps and conducting
						experiments, interpreting and analyzing the data at each
						level.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will formulate and design Electronic systems
						that would encompass Basic Electronics/Signal
						Processing/Processors or embedded systems/VLSI designs
						for ASICs/Control and Instrumentation/Communication
						Techniques and would meet specifications and
						requirements as demanded by the users (or to solve
						practical problem).
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will apply design on tools to develop
						simulated model or hardware prototype, will conduct
						experiments or tests on it for various input conditions
						i.e. utilize tools to investigate, analyze, design,
						simulate and/or fabricate/commission complete systems)
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates understand latest hardware and software
						tools/platforms, modern techniques and technologies,
						optimization techniques and algorithms to solve the
						given real life problems-both offline and real-time
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will have the confidence to apply
						engineering solutions in global and societal contexts,
						i.e. ability to design and fabricate a hardware and/or
						software system, a component thereof, and processes to
						meet desired performance needs, within realistic
						constraints.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will understand quantitative modeling and
						analysis of a broad array of systems-level decision
						problems concerned with economic efficiency, work
						design, productivity and quality with environmental
						focus and long term solution.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates should be capable of self-education and
						clearly understand the value of achieving perfection in
						their professional endeavors.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will participate as members of engineering
						and science laboratory teams, as well as members of
						multidisciplinary design teams
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will be proficient in English language in
						both verbal and written forms which will enable them to
						compete with graduates of international engineering
						institutions.
						<br />
						<br />
						- Graduates will be broadly educated and will have an
						understanding of the impact of engineering on society
						and confront contemporary issues.
						<br />
						<br />- Graduates will exhibit competency in choosing
						and applying appropriate resource management
						technique(s) so as to optimally utilize
						resources/finance in industry.
